# PurchaseTracker - Project Context

## 🎯 Project Vision

**PurchaseTracker** is a single-admin application designed to track company card purchases through automated bank transaction email parsing.

### Core Concept

- **Single Admin User** manages everything
- **Employees** are data records (NOT user accounts with login)
- **Cards** are assigned to employees and tracked through shifts
- **Bank emails** are synced from Gmail and automatically parsed
- **Purchases** are automatically extracted from emails
- **Admin** reviews and analyzes all spending

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

### Single-Admin Model
- One admin user, employees are data entries only
- All tables have `admin_user_id` foreign key
- RLS policies scope everything to admin user
- No employee authentication needed

### Card Shifts System
- Track when cards are assigned to employees
- Start/end times for each shift
- Purchases linked to shifts by card + time range
- Automatic employee association through active shifts

### Email Processing Pipeline

**Stage 1: Email Sync**
- Fetch emails from Gmail via OAuth
- Store raw emails with full HTML content
- Track sync history and status

**Stage 2: Parsing**
- Apply regex-based parsing rules
- Extract: amount, merchant, date, card number
- Create purchases automatically
- Handle timezone-aware timestamps (UTC storage)

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Tables

**employees**
- Employee records (name only, no email/department)
- Linked to cards through card_shifts

**cards**
- Company cards with last 4 digits
- Bank name, nickname, type
- Active/inactive status
- Unassigned to specific employees (shifts handle assignment)

**card_shifts**
- Tracks card assignment history
- start_time, end_time (nullable for ongoing)
- Links card → employee for time periods
- Used to calculate shift statistics

**purchases**
- Transaction records
- `purchase_date` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - actual transaction time
- `order_number` (VARCHAR(6)) - optional tracking number
- `reviewed_by_initials` (VARCHAR(10)) - reviewer initials instead of boolean
- Links to card, employee (via shifts)
- Auto-created from parsed emails

**parsing_rules**
- Regex patterns for email parsing
- Match criteria (sender, subject, body)
- Extraction patterns (amount, merchant, card, date)
- Priority system for rule ordering
- Active/inactive status

**raw_emails**
- Synced Gmail messages
- Full HTML body preserved
- Parsing status and errors
- Gmail message ID for deduplication

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Tech Stack
| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Next.js | 16.1.6 | Framework with App Router |
| React | 19.2.3 | UI library |
| TypeScript | Latest | Type safety |
| Supabase | Latest | PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS |
| Tailwind CSS | v4 | Styling |
| shadcn/ui | Latest | UI components |
| Redux Toolkit | Latest | State management |
| date-fns | 4.1.0 | Date formatting |
| Lucide React | Latest | Icons |

### Important Patterns

**Date Handling**
- Database stores TIMESTAMPTZ (UTC)
- `parseUTCDate()` utility appends 'Z' to force UTC interpretation
- Prevents timezone display bugs
- Purchase dates use email received_at if extraction fails

**Card Number Extraction**
- Handles multiple formats: `4537*****798****` or `**** 0798`
- Regex: `(\d{4})\*+\*{4}|\*{4}\s*(\d{4})`
- Pads 3-digit cards to 4 digits (e.g., `798` → `0798`)

**Shift Statistics**
- Filter purchases by card_id only (no employee_id check)
- Use purchase_date for time comparison
- Ongoing shifts use current time as end_time

**Pagination (Infinite Scroll)**
- Purchases: 100 items per batch using `.range()`
- Shifts: 20 ended shifts per batch
- IntersectionObserver for auto-loading
- Server-side filtering applied before pagination
- Smart reset: filters clear data and reload from page 1
- Redux state tracks: currentPage, hasMore, isLoadingMore

**Soft Deletes**
- Uses `deleted_at` TIMESTAMPTZ column
- All queries filter `.is('deleted_at', null)`
- Prevents permanent data loss
- Records can be restored by setting `deleted_at = NULL`

## 🔐 Security

### Authentication
- Supabase Auth with Google OAuth
- Server-side session validation
- Protected routes via middleware
- HttpOnly cookies

### Authorization
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- All queries filtered by `auth.uid() = admin_user_id`
- No cross-admin data access

### Gmail OAuth
- Minimal scopes (gmail.readonly, gmail.labels)
- Tokens encrypted in Supabase
- Auto-refresh on expiry
- Disconnectable anytime

## 📈 Data Flow

### Email Sync → Parse → Purchase
```
1. User clicks "Sync Gmail"
2. Fetch emails from Gmail API
3. Store in raw_emails (dedupe by gmail_message_id)
4. Auto-parse with active parsing rules
5. Extract: amount, merchant, card, date
6. Find card by last_four match
7. Create purchase record
8. Mark email as parsed
```

### Shift-Based Filtering
```
1. User clicks shift row
2. Navigate to purchases with filters:
   - cardId (UUID)
   - startDate (ISO timestamp)
   - endDate (ISO timestamp or null)
3. Auto-enable selection mode
4. Filter purchases by card + date range
5. Auto-select matching purchases
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Environment Variables Required
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=

## 📝 Known Behaviors

### Parsing
- Emails without card numbers in body won't link to cards
- Parse errors stored in raw_emails.parse_error
- Orphaned emails (parsed but no purchase) can be re-parsed
- Duplicate detection uses raw_email_id

### Shifts
- Multiple employees can use same card (overlaps possible)
- Ongoing shifts calculate stats in real-time
- Shift stats match by card + time range only

### Filters
- Date filters use purchase_date (transaction time)
- Reviewed filter checks for non-empty initials
- Card filter allows multiple selection

## 🎯 Future Considerations

### Short-term
- Scheduled auto-sync (cron job)
- Dashboard analytics with charts
- Receipt attachments
- Budget tracking

### Medium-term
- Gmail webhook push notifications
- Multi-currency support
- Advanced search/filtering
- Bulk operations

### Long-term
- Mobile app
- Audit logging
- Compliance reports
